# Double Debiased Machine Learning 

## Basics:

#### Problem:

Machine learning algorithms may be biased due to problems like overfitting, confounding, or really any source of bias.

#### Solution:

(From ChatGPT)

Fit two machine learning algorithms to predict outcome $\hat{Y}(X)$ and treatment $\hat{T}(X)$. Then calculate residuals from these predictions, $\tilde{Y} = Y - \hat{Y}(X)$ and $\tilde{T} = T - \hat{T}(X)$.

Then use these residuals to estimate the causal parameter $\hat{\theta}$ in the regression

$$\tilde{Y} = \theta \tilde{T} + \epsilon$$
